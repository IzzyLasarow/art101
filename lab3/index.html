	<h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>This lab has required hands on application of what we learned in class  to
			make our very own webpage. We both made a homepage and then worked on the
			layout of our Lab3 page together.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p> I personally struggled with the little erros such as forgetting to close
	the paragraphs. The major problem came when linking a photo because we
	couldn't figure out what to label the png.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p> Well hopefuly you are able to see our index.htm file that we have created,
		and everyhthing is swell.</p>
