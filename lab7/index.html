	       <h2>Challenges</h2>
	       <p>There was some confusion when linking our js to our html. When we
	         first wrote the code in js it was not showing up in the browser.</p>
	       <h2>Problems</h2>
	       <p>The issue I faced was due to forgeting commas and brackets.</p>
	       <h2>Results</h2>
	       <p>The finished result was more challenges then expected.</p>
