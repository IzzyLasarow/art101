  		<h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>There was some confusion when linking our js to our html. When we
        first wrote the code in js it was not showing up in the browser.</p>

  		<h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>The issue I faced was due to forgeting commas and brackets.</p>

  		<h2>Results</h2>
  		<p>The finished result was more challenges then expected.</p>
